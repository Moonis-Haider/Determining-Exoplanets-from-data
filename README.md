# Determining-Exoplanets-from-data
Applying Logistic Regression and XGBoost to Nasa Kepler Space Telescope data to classify exoplanets.
We use scikit-learn to train the models on our data and see how it performs on test data. After checking for anomalies, we find test performance of 74% and 90% accuracy respectively. We also learn that the observed planetary radius is consistently the most important feature across different models.
